This is a project which can encrypt and decrypt a given text on the basis of the following parameters:
	Shift Value
	Block Size

Giving Input: 
	1. First of All Enter the String which you want to encrypt.

	2. Next Enter a Shift Value which shifts the Character by a certain number.
		for eg : if the string is "ABCD" and the shift value is 2 then the resulting string will be "CDEF"
		
	3. Then Enter a Block Size which creates blocks of certain size and fills the remaining space with 'x'
		for eg : if the string is "CDEF" and the block size is 3 then the resulting string will be "CDE Fxx"

		THis gives you the Encrypted String.
		The decrypted string is the initial string removing all the spaces.
